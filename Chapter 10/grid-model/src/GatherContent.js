  text: "This photograph provides a God’s eye view of Turkey’s largest Syrian refugee camp taken by a drone. Ideology informs the design of shelters for displaced people, by arranging homes as if in a perspectival grid that organizes, manages and contains it inhabitants. The emphasis in the photograph on the planar and linear leaves out texture, straightening and arranging what could be perceived as deviance. Where one can circulate is restricted and prescribed. Their freedom is limited. What's complicated and vulnerable becomes smoothly encased and hidden. The camp as a designed living space is on a flat raised terrain, with no plant structures, no shade, no cultural centers, public transportation, it is remote and isolated. Yellow brown arid ground indicates a hot and dry climate. Small squares of shade help protect but are they enough to seek refuge from the environmental conditions of heat? The camp land is doubly enclosed, both within the fence, the surrounding road, and the hill. A small parking lot to the bottom of the image shows vehicles but we know they don’t belong to the residents who are isolated spatially and marginalized from society at large.",

  text: "These cube-like building shapes lend themselves to being drawn and photographed for understanding linear perspective because they are simple and made of right angles.In Chapter 4, we learned about perspective in the context of realism, as informing our understanding of space while deploying principles about society. Linear perspective and the rationality of the grid eliminate embodied presence and subjective positions, being procedural and eliminating chaos. From above, bodies are almost unnoticeable in the image, as if the camp is deserted and its residents are tucked neatly away.",

Orbiting as a force with machine agency, these feed our view of human survival. They create them. A wild range of drones exist which do things for and with us humans.  In the above image we see a camera has been installed, for recording videos, taking still photographs, or data collection. More than a toy, these call on our knowledge of armed drone killings in military combat, wildlife harming, or police surveillance.",

A counter-attack on drone users and unjust warfare was designed to be visible to satellites and aerial cameras. By blowing up the image of a single child victim killed by aerial warfare, unrolling the poster as an image that now became visible to those looking from above, the child returns the gaze emanating from the God’s eye view in the large-scale installation project #NotABugSplat to call attention to the real lives of child victims and the value of civilian lives dehumanized by machinic vision in a heavily bombed area of Pakistan.",

On either side of the image there are two vanishing points, one on the right and one on the left that go beyond the frame of the photograph. Therefore a two-point perspective grid is easy to create for this image because the buildings are already arranged in grid-fashion, lined up along straight lines that intersect at square angles, meeting at the front bottom of the image. Even with no knowledge of drawing, if you follow the outer edges of the buildings or drew a line through them, you will get a grid. To return to the photograph itself, note that it also teaches us about scale: the size of the road helps us to compare it to the scale of the housing units, which appear to be smaller than a two-lane road.
