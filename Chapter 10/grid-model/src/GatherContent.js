  text: "This photograph provides a God’s eye view of Turkey’s largest Syrian refugee camp taken by a drone. Ideology informs the design of shelters for displaced people, by arranging homes as if in a perspectival grid that organizes, manages and contains it inhabitants. The emphasis in the photograph on the planar and linear leaves out texture, straightening and arranging what could be perceived as deviance. Where one can circulate is restricted and prescribed. Their freedom is limited. What's complicated and vulnerable becomes smoothly encased and hidden. The camp as a designed living space is on a flat raised terrain, with no plant structures, no shade, no cultural centers, public transportation, it is remote and isolated. Yellow brown arid ground indicates a hot and dry climate. Small squares of shade help protect but are they enough to seek refuge from the environmental conditions of heat? The camp land is doubly enclosed, both within the fence, the surrounding road, and the hill. A small parking lot to the bottom of the image shows vehicles but we know they don’t belong to the residents who are isolated spatially and marginalized from society at large.",

  text: "These cube-like building shapes lend themselves to being drawn and photographed for understanding linear perspective because they are simple and made of right angles.In Chapter 4, we learned about perspective in the context of realism, as informing our understanding of space while deploying principles about society. Linear perspective and the rationality of the grid eliminate embodied presence and subjective positions, being procedural and eliminating chaos. From above, bodies are almost unnoticeable in the image, as if the camp is deserted and its residents are tucked neatly away.",
